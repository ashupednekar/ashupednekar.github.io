# Welcome to Ashu's Blog! ðŸš€

Hi there! Iâ€™m Ashutosh Pednekar, but most people call me Ashu (itâ€™s shorter, snappier, and honestly, who has the time?). This blog is where I share my adventures in code, from wrestling with **Rust** to making **Python** do backflipsâ€”and sometimes just ranting about life as a developer.

I like building things that are fast, reliable, and occasionally held together by duct tape and hope. Whether itâ€™s distributed systems, task schedulers, or figuring out why the test only fails on *my* machine, youâ€™ll probably find traces of my overthinking here.

## Why This Blog?

- **To Learn:** Explaining things makes me feel like I almost understand them.
- **To Share:** Maybe youâ€™ll learn something newâ€”or get a laugh at my expense.
- **To Connect:** Because coding is fun, but memes are better with friends.

So, grab your debugging snacks, poke around, and feel free to reach out with questions or, more likely, corrections. Letâ€™s make something cool (or at least functional) together!
