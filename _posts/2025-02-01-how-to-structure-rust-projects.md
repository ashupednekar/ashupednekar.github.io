# How to structure a rust project?

If you are coming from other languages like say, python or java which means you are mostly working with certain frameworks and would be used to having a defined way of structuring your projects, or even automated tools that do that for you. Whereas modern languages like rust, go, zig don't impose any such structure on you and we instead follow common conventions.

## Preface

Here's a popular blueprint for go by the streamer Melkey: [go-blueprint](https://github.com/Melkeydev/go-blueprint/). This includes a cli that lets you select things you need and build out the scaffolding for you, kind of like springboot.

Rust is mainly a systems language and has varied applications, the web being just one of these. This is probably the reason why there's no such convention available right now, maybe that's something we can look at in the future.

This blog will cover my go-to standard, which is completely based on my personal preference/ inclinations, and heavily inspired by go's `pkg`/`cmd` convention, which I think makes a lot of sense in general. This is not a hard and fast boilerplate, just a starter kit that can help push your rust projects to be in good enough shape that you can stop worrying about the structure and just build what you want, and fight the borrow checker of course ;)

> note: This is suitable for small to medium sized projects that mainly belong to the following categories
> - web services
> - cli tools 

## Dependencies

Let's start with a `cargo new` to create a bin crate. Once that's done, proceed to add two modules, `cmd` and `pkg`. The pkg module is gonna house all our abstractions and utilities while the cmd takes care of the thing s that run these utilities like accepting cli args or starting a server

Let's start by adding the following dependencies to `Cargo.toml`


Instead of sprinking `env::var("MY_ENV")` everywhere, it's better to have a lazy loaded settings struct.
```toml
lazy_static = "1.5.0"
config = "0.15.6"
```

The serde wizards will parse our envs for us with customizations like custom aliases, or even custom deserializers... more on that later
```toml
serde = { version = "1.0.217", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "1.0.136"
```

Now, if you've worked with something like `django` before, you must be familiar with management commands right? Things like db migrations, server startup, cli client, seperate gRPC server, etc can be invoked through cli arguments with the best Cli library ever made, i.e. `clap`.
```toml
clap = { version = "4.5.26", features = ["derive"] }
```

This one is optional, but definitely recommended. Let's add the dependencies for tracing and telemetry
```toml
tracing = "0.1.40"
tracing-opentelemetry = "0.27.0"
tracing-subscriber = { version = "0.3", features = ["env-filter"] }
opentelemetry = "0.26.0"
opentelemetry-otlp = { version = "0.26.0", features = ["default", "tracing"] }
opentelemetry_sdk = { version = "0.26.0", features = ["rt-tokio"] }
tracing-test = "0.2.5"
```


Then ofcourse, proceed to add your other dependencies, say `axum` for apis, `sqlx`/`diesel` for databases, `reqwest`, `thiserror`, `chrono` etc, and don't forget the main one, `tokio` :)


## Sample use case

I'll go with rolling our own simple `auth` service so that we can have a relatable example and cover all bases

```bash
cargo new auth-svc
    Creating binary (application) `auth-svc` package
note: see more `Cargo.toml` keys and their definitions at https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html
(base) Desktop ‚ùØ cd auth-svc
(base) src git:master ‚ùØ mkdir pkg                                                             ‚ú≠
(base) src git:master ‚ùØ touch pkg/mod.rs                                                      ‚ú≠
(base) src git:master ‚ùØ mkdir cmd                                                             ‚ú≠
(base) src git:master ‚ùØ touch cmd/mod.rs                                                      ‚ú≠
(base) auth-svc git:master ‚ùØ tree                                                             ‚ú≠
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Cargo.lock
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Cargo.toml
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ src
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cmd
    ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ mod.rs
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.rs
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pkg
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ mod.rs

4 directories, 5 files
```

I've added the dependencies like so...
```rust
[dependencies]
lazy_static = "1.5.0"
config = "0.15.6"
serde = { version = "1.0.217", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "1.0.136"
clap = { version = "4.5.26", features = ["derive"] }
tracing = "0.1.40"
tracing-opentelemetry = "0.27.0"
tracing-subscriber = { version = "0.3", features = ["env-filter"] }
opentelemetry = "0.26.0"
opentelemetry-otlp = { version = "0.26.0", features = ["default", "tracing"] }
opentelemetry_sdk = { version = "0.26.0", features = ["rt-tokio"] }
tracing-test = "0.2.5"
tokio = { version = "1.43.0", features = ["full"] }
thiserror = "2.0.11"
```


## Prelude

The prelude module contains something we'll end up using throughout, our `Error` and `Result` types, let's go ahead and add these

Define the module in `main.rs` with `mod prelude;` and add a `prelude.rs` file, alongside `main.rs`

```rust
use thiserror::Error;

#[derive(Debug, Error)]
pub enum CustomError{
    #[error("some variant")]
    SomeVariant
}

pub type Result<T> = core::result::Result<T, CustomError>;
```

We'll import this result type with `use crate::prelude::Result` going forward

As and when we come across more cases, we'll come back and add variants to the `CustomError` enum

## Config

Next, go ahead and add a `conf` module like we just did with `prelude` and add the following contents

```rust
use config::{Config, ConfigError, Environment};
use lazy_static::lazy_static;
use serde::Deserialize;

#[derive(Deserialize)]
pub struct Settings {
}

impl Settings {
    pub fn new() -> Result<Self, ConfigError> {
        let conf = Config::builder()
            .add_source(Environment::default())
            .build()?;
        conf.try_deserialize()
    }
}

lazy_static! {
    pub static ref settings: Settings = Settings::new().expect("improperly configured");
}
```

Here's what happening here...
- The config crate with it's `Config::builder()` reads environment variables and uses `serde` to parse them into a given struct
- The `lazy_static` macro lets us define a constant called settings that'd be evaluated in a lazy fashion

Now add a config.env at the project root, and let's add one env for illustration, say `LISTEN_PORT`, which also needs a corresponding property in our `Settings` struct

```rust
#[derive(Deserialize)]
pub struct Settings {
    pub listen_port: String
}
```

Note that the case doesn't have to be capitalized here, config and serde takes care of that for us. You can also have certain envs as optional, by simply using wrapping it with an `Option`, like so

```rust
#[derive(Deserialize)]
pub struct Settings {
    pub listen_port: String,
    pub otlp_host: Option<String>,
    pub otlp_port: Option<String>
}
```

Here, I've added two more settings, the host/port of our traces server, more on that later which are optional envs

You can ofcouse have other types as well

```rust
#[derive(Deserialize)]
pub struct Settings {
    pub listen_port: String,
    pub otlp_host: Option<String>,
    pub otlp_port: Option<String>,
    pub use_telemetry: bool
}
```

## The entrypoint üëè

So far, we've not added anything to our main

![meme](https://i.redd.it/a2n75ff2gvk41.jpg)

Before we do that, let's set up our `cmd` module. This will essentially be a `clap` cli, with sub commands for various things out application can do, like we talked about earlier

Add the `cmd` as a module to `main.rs` with `mod cmd;` and head over to `src/cmd/mod.rs`

First, let's import our `settings` and `Result` we just definedm and the `Parser`/`Subcommand` macros from the `clap` crate

```rust
use crate::{prelude::Result, conf::settings};
use clap::{Parser, Subcommand};
```

Now we need to define a `Cmd` struct and a `SubCommandType` enum like so

```rust
#[derive(Parser)]
#[command(about="lets you run auth-svc commands")]
struct Cmd{
    #[command(subcommand)]
    command: Option<SubCommandType>
}

#[derive(Subcommand)]
enum SubCommandType{
    Listen,
    Migrate,
}
```

Let's start with two commands here, `Listen`, which is gonna start our server and `Migrate`, which will set up our db tables, akin to django's `runserver` and `migrate`

Then define a `run` function which will invoke clap's argument parsing and later invoke the respective utilities

```rust
pub async fn run() -> Result<()>{
    let args = Cmd::parse();
    match args.command{
        Some(SubCommandType::Listen) => {
            //start server
        },
        Some(SubCommandType::Migrate) => {
            //run diesel/sqlx migrations
        },
        None => {
            tracing::error!("no subcommand passed")
        }
    }
    Ok(())
}
```

Now go ahead and call this from your `main.rs`

```rust
mod prelude;
mod conf;
mod cmd;

use crate::prelude::Result;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<()> {
    tracing_subscriber::fmt::init();

    cmd::run().await?;
    Ok(())
}
```

Few things to note:
- we've used the `tokio::main` macro to make our main function run within a tokio runtime
- we've used the `Result` from `prelude` so that we can use the `?` operator on our `run` call
- note that run is awaited since it's an async function
- the `tracing_subscriber::fmt::init()` line initiates the tracing module to work with `stdout` to print our logs


Now, if we run `cargo run help`, clap will kindly print out a useful help it generated for our cli

```bash
(base) auth-svc git:main ‚ùØ cargo run help
Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.17s
  Running `target/debug/auth-svc help`
lets you run auth-svc commands

Usage: auth-svc [COMMAND]

Commands:
  listen
  migrate
  help     Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
  -h, --help  Print help
```

If I call without passing any subcommands, our error log will show up, like so

```bash
cargo run
  Running `target/debug/auth-svc`
2025-02-01T06:53:30.148276Z ERROR auth_svc::cmd: no subcommand passed
```

Once we add and invoke out utilities, we could run our server with `cargo run listen`, or `./auth listen` once compiled into a static binary
