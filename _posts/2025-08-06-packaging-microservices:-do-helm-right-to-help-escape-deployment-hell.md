### Preface
Alright, let's do this. In this article, I'm gonna walk through what's packaging, how it was done in the past, and eventually land at the mess we've created for ourselves recently ðŸ™ƒ 

What tools like helm does is help us sort out this mess/ or mesh, if you will... and give users or fellow devs a decent experience

### Traditional packaging

So software was traditionally shipped as executable binaries, be it `exe`s on windows you installed as a kid, or the elf binaries you `chmod +x` and move to `'/usr/local/bin` once you got cool ðŸ˜Ž, they are all the same, with certain exceptions. 

what's helm, what it's not... why it's needed

### kubernetes, what is simplifies and what it makes worse

### glimpse at the alternative

### analogous to linux package managers

### superpowers - lib charts
