## So you wanna speed up Python?

Alright, buckle up, Pythonistas, because shared libraries are here to save the day! But forget C (because weâ€™re not touched by the arcane), and say hello to Rustâ€”our favorite mix of performance and sanity.


## Why Rust?

1. ðŸ¦€ Fast: Rust zips through code like your Wi-Fi when your neighbors arenâ€™t stealing it.

2. Safe: Unlike your average Python dev at 3 AM, Rust wonâ€™t let you shoot yourself in the foot.

3. Shared Libs: Because why rewrite everything when you can just wrap the spicy Rust bits and call them from Python?


## The Game Plan


Weâ€™re gonna:

1. Write some ðŸ”¥ Rust code.

2. Turn it into a shared library (.so for Linux folks, .dll for Windows weirdos).

3. Slap some Python bindings on it (thanks, PyO3!).

4. Marvel as your Python code finally slithers quickly instead of dragging along
