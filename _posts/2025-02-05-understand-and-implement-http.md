## HTTP - intro

Buckle up, we're gonna dive into HTTP, the protocol that powers the internet. I'm not going to start with "HTTP stands for hyper tex..", we all learnt that as kids. As developers, we can understand it at a much simpler and relatable way.

## What's a protocol anyway?

Certain terms tend to intimidate folks, especially as junior engineers, and protocol is definitely one of them. Once you realize that all software is written by developers like you and me, things do get easier. So what is a protocol then?

Like the english word, a protocol is nothing but a set of rules that are agreed upon and followed by everyone. And network protocols can be simply be thought of as `PAYLOAD FORMATS`, that's it. Seriously, your openapi spec could be called a protocol if enough people use it! ðŸ˜„ (S3, openai are a few examples...)

So what's so special about HTTP then? It's an application layer text based protocol that's designed for exchanging text and bytes over TCP. Let's get a quick refresher on the OSI model

If you come from CS, you've seen this diagram a thousand times already. But here we go again... If you're new to OSI, don't worry, we'll cover all you need to know right here
